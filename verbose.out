Redemption: one re-attempt allowed on one individual assignment with initial score < 2; resubmission due within 72 hours; max is min(2.0, 2x initial). Translation tools permitted only with AI features disabled and with required uploads of original language text, raw translation output, and tool disclosure. Mobile devices should not be used during class (except for viewing notes during presentations). All assignments are due at 11:59 pm Pittsburgh local time on the indicated date."
